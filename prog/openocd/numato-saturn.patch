+# Numato Saturn - Spartan 6 FPGA Development Board With DDR SDRAM
+#
+# https://numato.com/saturn-spartan-6-fpga-development-board-with-ddr-sdram
+#
+# IMPORTANT:
+#   To use openocd with Saturn using its onboard FTDI chip,
+#   put the jumpers P10 and P11 in following configuration:
+#
+#   P10: Jumpers one each between 2-4 and 3-5
+#   P11: Jumpers one each between 2-4 and 3-5
+#
+# NOTE:
+#   To put the jumpers configuration back to factory configuration (SPI flash connnections):
+#
+#   P10: Jumpers one each between 1-2 and 5-6
+#   P11: Jumpers one each between 1-2 and 5-6
